# StuScraper

This project is currently unmaintained.

CLI tool to scrape Stuudium's ope.ee sites for user information.

Requres an account on site.

The current code doen't work as intended, but I belive the fix isn't that hard. The codebase itself is a bit suboptimally written, but I don't care for the code for now. Feel free to fork and maintain the project!

## Stu-cli

login works with password and with Smart-ID.

Some outdated examples can be found at [examples](./assets/examples.md)
