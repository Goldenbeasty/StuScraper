# StuScraper
CLI tool for Stuudium

WIP but implemented functions are: user database downloading, user search, chat viewing, viewing grades and homework

## stu-cli
Currently logging in only works with Smart-ID, password login should work, needs to be tested

## config.ini

Configuration data different for everyone

Automatically updated values: `usercount`, `user_card_url`

Absoulutely needed configuration values: 

> `hostname` - set it what your subdoman for yor stuudium is(for example hostname for Miina Härma gümnaasium is `mhg`, while for Tartu Tamme kool is `tartutamme`)

> `selfid` - needed for the grades page, soon to be redundant, as this can be concidered a bug
