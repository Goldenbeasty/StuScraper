# StuScraper
CLI tool for Stuudium

WIP but implemented functions are: user database downloading, user search, chat viewing, creating messages, viewing grades and homework

## stu-cli
Currently logging in only works with Smart-ID, password login should work, needs to be tested

## First time login

On the first login the script creates a config.ini file and sets up your school. The school search is the same as on the website, but you might encounter some test "schools", what should be ignored.
If you want to log into another schools Stuudium just delete the config.ini file and run the script again.
